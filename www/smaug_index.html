<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>SMAUG II</strong> is a <strong>Merc</strong> and <strong>DikuMUD</strong> derived MUD server. Its name is a
 backronym inspired by the dragon <strong>Smaug</strong> found in <strong>J. R. R. Tolkien's</strong> fiction.
 <strong>SMAUG II</strong> is a multiplayer text-based role-playing game in a real-time virtual world, which is a type of
 MUD. Modern massively multiplayer online role-playing games <strong>(MMORPGs)</strong> traces directly back to the MUD genre.</p>
<p><strong>SMAUG II</strong> is an enhancenment of <strong>SMAUG 1.8b</strong>, the goal is to develop a new structure
 to build and run in modern distributed system environments. It can be used and modified to create your own game server.
 <strong>SMAUG 1.8b</strong>, is an fixed <strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> which is a heavily modified derivative of the
 <strong>Merc 2.1</strong> distribution.</p>
<p><strong>SMAUG 1.4a</strong> is close to six times the size of <strong>Merc 2.1</strong>, and has major changes to the inner 
 workings of the code, hence making porting of code from other Diku-derivatives non-trivial to the non-coder. Due to the ability 
 to edit most everything online, you will most likely find the online help pages more informative. <strong>SMAUG</strong> is the 
 base code that runs the popular <strong>Realms of Despair</strong> MUD. Through the years it has been tweaked, modified, and 
 enhanced to become one of the most feature packed branches of the <strong>MERC</strong> family of codebases.</p>
<p><strong>SMAUG</strong> is a derivative of <strong>Merc Diku Mud</strong> is a <strong>Diku Mud</strong> with many 
 enhancements and contributions. It was written in 1990 and 1991 by <strong>Sebastian Hammer</strong>, <strong>Tom Madsen</strong>, 
 <strong>Katja Nyboe</strong>, <strong>Michael Seifert</strong>, and <strong>Hans Henrik Stærfeldt</strong> at 
 <strong>DIKU</strong> <i>(Datalogisk Institut Københavns Universitet)—the department of computer science at the University of 
 Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark</i>. Commonly referred to as simply "<strong>Diku</strong>", the game was greatly inspired 
 by <strong>AberMUD</strong>, though Diku became one of the first multi-user games to become popular as a freely-available 
 program for its gameplay and similarity to <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>AberMUD</strong> was the first popular open source MUD. It was named after the town <strong>Aberystwyth</strong>, 
 in which it was written. The first version was written in <strong>B</strong> by <strong>Alan Cox</strong>, <strong>Richard 
 Acott</strong>, <strong>Jim Finnis</strong>, and <strong>Leon Thrane</strong> based at <strong>University of Wales</strong>, 
 <strong>Aberystwyth</strong> for an old <strong>Honeywell</strong> mainframe and opened in 1987.</p>
