### Support or Contact

Having trouble with **--{SMAUG}--**?

First, check out the documentation at **[--{SMAUG}-- Wiki] (https://github.com/smaugmuds/xmerc/wiki)** or send an Issue and we'll help you sort it out.

We rewrote all of the documentation files for the **--{SMAUG}-- 2.0 Release**, and have been keeping them up-to-date since.

Also check the **'wizhelp'**, **'help'**, **'hlist'** commands and read the **'help'** descriptions for the individual immortal commands.

When you write us, we need to know what kind of machine you're running on.  If you can give us specific information about the problem, that helps too.

Specific information means: an **adb** or **gdb** stack trace (if you're reporting a crash), or a **syslog** with the relevant commands logged. The player files are ascii files dump them into your mail message too.

You can also read the Documentation in the **'doc'** directory.
