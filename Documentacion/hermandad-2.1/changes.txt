Changes to the clan system since release 1.0

 1.1 added the ability to promote someone to mortal leader status,
     regardless of their clan rank.

 1.2 fixed a bug in the "can_" functions.  Although they seemed to
     work just fine, the call being made to "is_leader" did not
     include the ch. heh. was changed from !is_leader, to !is_leader(ch)
     Dont ask me why this even compiled like that, let alone seemed to
     work.....

     changed the way "who_name" is shown in the "do_who" command.

     added support for moving corpses to the morgue room. 

     fixed bug that allowed players who "can_guild" to be able to
     guild new players into guilds other than their own.   

     changed it so that SUPREMES can promote outside of their own
     guild. (found it very annoying, having to guild myself to another
     guild just to promote a mortal who's guild imm wasnt around...)


 1.3 Fixed a bug (Thanks to Mat Reda) in raw_kill.



 1.4 Fixed a few more bugs (Thanks to Zak Johnson (zakj@usa.net)
     These were mostly related to promotion, although the feature
     was working, these fixes will make things run as intended. ;)
  
     This release was the last of the version 1 releases.


 2.0 Added flags, olc editor (gedit) another room was added (temple)
     see the file "README.1ST" for more detailed data on these changes.

 2.1 Fixes a few small bugs. Related to "gedit_list" and "gedit_create",
     also I rewrote the install.txt file.
